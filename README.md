====================

Hello world example using the Vane framework. Prepped and ready for deployment to [DartVoid](http://www.dartvoid.com/).

## Vane

[Vane](https://github.com/DartVoid/Vane) is a server-side framework for Dart. When you deploy your Vane applications to DartVoid an optimized `server.dart` file is autogenerated.

## Try it out

### Deploy (recommended)

1. [Sign up](http://www.dartvoid.com/signup/) for a DartVoid account
2. Sign in to the management portal
3. Create a new application from this template
4. Enable and test the application

### Local testing (Linux or Mac)

Currently if you want to test a Vane application locally you need to write a simple server.dart file.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'hello_world.dart' show HelloWorld;
  
void main() {
  HttpServer.bind('127.0.0.1', 8080).then((server) {
    server.listen((req) => new HelloWorld()(req));
  });
}
```

Start the server

```bash
  dart server/server.dart
```

Test it from the command line

```bash
  curl "127.0.0.1:8080/hello?msg=World"
```
